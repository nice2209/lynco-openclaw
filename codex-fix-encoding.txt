Task: Fix mojibake / broken Korean text in the Lynco landing page.

Repo/workdir: C:\Users\admin\.openclaw\workspace\lynco\web

Context:
- Landing page is implemented in src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx with many Korean strings, but some are garbled (mojibake), e.g. "Sales �� Cash ��" and many broken Korean strings.
- We need to convert those strings to correct Korean copy consistent with docs in ..\\docs\\landing-copy.md and ..\\docs\\flowmap.md.

Requirements:
1) Update src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx:
   - Replace all garbled strings with correct Korean (and keep some English labels if desired, but Korean should be readable).
   - Replace the Flow Map highlighted node label from "???" to "딸깍" (or another meaningful Korean label) and update the callout text accordingly.
   - Ensure section copy is consistent, concise, confident (Deep Green/Charcoal B2B tone).
2) If any other files have garbled Korean, fix them too.
3) Keep file encoding as UTF-8.
4) Run npm run lint and npm run build; fix any issues.
5) Print progress milestones in stdout at [0%],[10%]...[100%] with 1-2 bullets each.
6) Final output: short summary of files changed.

When done, run this command to notify:
openclaw gateway wake --text "Done: Fixed Korean text encoding (mojibake) on Lynco landing; lint+build passing" --mode now
